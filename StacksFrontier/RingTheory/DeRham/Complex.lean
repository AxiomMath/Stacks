# The de Rham complex of a ring map, as a cochain complex

Let `A → B` be a map of commutative rings, let `Ω[B⁄A]` be the module of Kähler differentials
with its universal `A`-derivation `d = KaehlerDifferential.D A B`, and write
`Ω^p_{B/A} = ⋀[B]^p Ω[B⁄A]`.  `KaehlerDifferential.deRhamDifferential p` is the unique `A`-linear
map `Ω^p_{B/A} → Ω^{p+1}_{B/A}` with

`d (b₀ · d b₁ ∧ ⋯ ∧ d b_p) = d b₀ ∧ d b₁ ∧ ⋯ ∧ d b_p`.

The property that makes that family a *complex*, that consecutive differentials compose to zero,
is `KaehlerDifferential.deRhamDifferential_comp_deRhamDifferential` of
`StacksFrontier/RingTheory/DeRham/Basic.lean`.  Here the family is packaged as an honest
`CochainComplex` of `A`-modules indexed by `ℕ`, together with the statement that the defining rule
above determines that complex.

## Main definitions

* `KaehlerDifferential.deRhamComplex`: **the de Rham complex `Ω^0_{B/A} → Ω^1_{B/A} → ⋯` of
  `B` over `A`** ([Stacks, Tag 0FKF]), as a `CochainComplex (ModuleCat A) ℕ`.  The construction
  takes no hypothesis: its arrows are `deRhamDifferential` and its square-zero condition is the
  theorem cited above.

## Main results

* `KaehlerDifferential.deRhamComplex_X` and `KaehlerDifferential.deRhamComplex_d`: the terms
  and the arrows of `deRhamComplex`.
* `KaehlerDifferential.deRhamComplex_d_smul_ιMulti_D`: the defining rule, read on the arrows of
  `deRhamComplex`.
* `KaehlerDifferential.deRhamComplex_unique`: any family of `A`-linear maps obeying the defining
  rule assembles into `deRhamComplex`, whatever square-zero proof it is given.

## Implementation notes

The terms are `A`-modules and not `B`-modules, because the differentials are `A`-linear only:
already in degree `0` the Leibniz rule gives `d (b b') = b · d b' + b' · d b`.  Unlike
`Stacks.DeRham.DifferentialDescent.SrcA`, which carries the `A`-module structure through the
`RestrictScalars` type synonym, the terms here are the exterior powers themselves with the
`A`-action they already have by `IsScalarTower A B _`; that is the structure
`deRhamDifferential` is stated for, so no transport along a synonym is ever needed.  Both ring
universes are tied together, `A B : Type u`, because the objects of `ModuleCat.{u} A` are types
in `Type u` while `⋀[B]^p Ω[B⁄A]` lives in `Type (max u v)`; this is forced by the target
category and not a choice.
