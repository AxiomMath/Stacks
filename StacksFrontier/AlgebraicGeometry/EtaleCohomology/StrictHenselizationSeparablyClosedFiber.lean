# Étale cohomology over a separably closed point of a strict henselization

Let `f : X ⟶ S` be a morphism of schemes, let `x̄` be a geometric point of `X` with image `s̄` in
`S`, and let `Spec K ⟶ Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})` be a point of the strict henselization of `S` at `s̄`
with `K` separably closed. For an abelian sheaf `ℱ` on the small étale site of `Spec K` and
`q ≥ 0`, Tag 0EZV asserts the equivalence of

1. `H^q(Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{X,x̄}) ×_S Spec K, ℱ) = H^q(Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K, ℱ)`,
2. `H^q(Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{X,x̄}) ×_{Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})} Spec K, ℱ) = H^q(Spec K, ℱ)`,

each equality read as bijectivity of the canonical restriction map.

The two restriction maps are taken along base changes of one and the same morphism, the morphism
of strict henselizations `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{X,x̄}) ⟶ Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})` of Tag 0GJN: along the
projection `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K ⟶ Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})` in the first case and along the
given point `Spec K ⟶ Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})` in the second. The source deduces the equivalence from
the fact that, `K` being separably closed, `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` is a cofiltered limit
of finite disjoint unions of copies of `Spec K` over nonempty index sets, so that both cohomology
groups of (1) are groups of locally constant functions on the limit index space with values in
the corresponding groups of (2).

## Main definitions

* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.specIsoSigmaOfIsSepClosed` — the spectrum of an étale algebra over a
  separably closed field is a finite coproduct of copies of the spectrum of that field.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.strictHenselizationFiberMap` — the canonical morphism
  `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{X,x̄}) ×_S Spec K ⟶ Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K`.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.strictHenselizationBaseFiberSection` — the section of the projection
  `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K ⟶ Spec K` determined by the given point.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.strictHenselizationBaseFiberIsoSpec` — the identification of
  `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` with `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄} ⊗_{𝒪_{S,s}} K)`.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.SepClosedFiberLocallyConstantPresentation` — data exhibiting the
  restriction map of condition (1) as the map induced by the restriction map of condition (2) on
  locally constant functions on a nonempty space.

## Main results

* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.finite_primeSpectrum_of_etale` — an étale algebra over a field has
  finitely many primes.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.isPullback_strictHenselizationFiberMap` — the morphism
  `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{X,x̄}) ×_S Spec K ⟶ Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` is a base change of the
  morphism of strict henselizations.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.isAffine_strictHenselizationBaseFiber`,
  `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.isAffine_strictHenselizationSourceFiber`,
  `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.isAffine_strictHenselizationPointFiber` — all three fibre products
  occurring in the tag are affine, although `S` need not be.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.indEtale_strictHenselizationBaseFiberRing` — the coordinate ring of
  `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` is ind-étale over `K`, that is, a filtered colimit of étale
  `K`-algebras. This is the first sentence of the source's proof.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.locallyConstant_map_bijective_iff` — post-composition with a map is
  bijective on locally constant functions on a nonempty space exactly when the map is.
* `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.bijective_strictHenselizationFiberRestriction_iff_of_presentation` is
  **Stacks 0EZV**, the equivalence of the two conditions, given such a presentation.

## Implementation notes

An equality of cohomology groups of the source is read, as elsewhere in the library, as
bijectivity of the canonical restriction map
`Stacks.EtaleCohomology.etaleCohomologyRestrictionMap` on `H^q`. The coefficient sheaf upstairs
is accordingly the inverse image along the comparison morphism of the coefficient sheaf
downstairs, which is itself the inverse image of `ℱ` along the projection to `Spec K`; the source
writes `ℱ` for all four groups.

The equivalence of the tag's two conditions carries `@[stacks 0EZV]`. What is carried as the
explicit datum `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.SepClosedFiberLocallyConstantPresentation`, rather than
constructed, is the cohomological identification of the source's proof: that the two cohomology
groups over `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` are locally constant functions on the limit index
space, compatibly with restriction. The geometric input that identification rests on is proved
here: the local structure of étale schemes over a separably closed field, the identification
which turns both conditions into conditions on base changes of a single morphism, the affineness
of all three fibre products, and the presentation of the coordinate ring of
`Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` as a filtered colimit of étale `K`-algebras. What is missing is

* the passage from ind-étaleness of the coordinate ring to an explicit cofiltered limit of
  schemes. `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.indEtale_strictHenselizationBaseFiberRing` says that ring is a
  filtered colimit of étale `K`-algebras and
  `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.specIsoSigmaOfIsSepClosed` turns each of those into a finite coproduct
  of copies of `Spec K`, but `StacksDraft.IndEtale` is phrased through
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.ind`, and neither the extraction of a directed family of
  étale subalgebras from it — the converse of
  `StacksDraft.indEtale_of_directed_etale_subalgebras` — nor the identification of `Spec` of a
  filtered colimit of rings with the cofiltered limit of their spectra is available;
* the distribution of that limit through the base change along the morphism of strict
  henselizations. The stages of the limit carry no morphism to `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})` — only the
  limit does, since the structure map `𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄} ⟶ 𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄} ⊗_{𝒪_{S,s}} K` factors
  through no stage — so the source's identification of the base change with the limit of the
  stagewise base changes is not an instance of base change commuting with limits. The copies of
  `Spec K` appearing in the stages correspond to the different `K`-points of
  `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})`, and that their base changes along the morphism of strict henselizations
  all agree is an identification the source does not state; and
* the passage from the resulting limit of schemes to the colimit of cohomology groups. The
  library's form of Theorem 09YQ,
  `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.AffineLimitCohomology.etaleCohomologyColimit_isColimit_of_affine`,
  covers the affine levels occurring here, but computes the right-derived `sheafSections` on the
  small *affine* étale sites; transporting it to the `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.H` of the small étale
  site used by `Stacks.EtaleCohomology.etaleCohomologyRestrictionMap` along Tag 04HR
  (`AlgebraicGeometry.SmallAffineEtale.inclusion_isSpecialCocontinuous`) is not carried out
  anywhere in the library.

The index space of the presentation is a topological space and the two identifications are of
locally constant functions on it, rather than a filtered colimit of finite direct sums over the
index sets: for a cofiltered limit of finite discrete spaces the two descriptions agree, and the
locally constant form is what the final step uses. Nonemptiness of the index space is a field of
the datum; its geometric source is
`Stacks.EtaleCohomology.strictHenselizationBaseFiberSection`, the section of the projection
coming from the given point of the strict henselization, which is the source's reason for the
index sets `A_i` being nonempty.

presentation into a finite coproduct of copies of `Spec K`, it is the geometric input the tag's
limit computation rests on. -/

/-- **The limit presentation of the cohomology over `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K`.** Since `K`
is separably closed, that scheme is a cofiltered limit of finite disjoint unions of copies of
`Spec K` over nonempty index sets, and cohomology turns the limit into a colimit (Theorem 09YQ).
This datum records the resulting description of both cohomology groups of condition (1) of
Tag 0EZV as locally constant functions on a nonempty space `A` with values in the corresponding
cohomology groups of condition (2), together with the fact that under it the restriction map of
condition (1) is computed pointwise from the restriction map of condition (2).

Constructing this datum is what remains of the proof of Tag 0EZV; see the module
documentation. -/

/-- **Stacks Project, Tag 0EZV.** Let `f : X ⟶ S` be a morphism of schemes, let `x̄` be a
geometric point of `X` with image `s̄` in `S`, let `Spec K ⟶ Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})` be a morphism
with `K` a separably closed field, let `ℱ` be an abelian sheaf on the small étale site of
`Spec K` and let `q ≥ 0`. Then
`H^q(Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{X,x̄}) ×_S Spec K, ℱ) = H^q(Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K, ℱ)` holds if and
only if `H^q(Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{X,x̄}) ×_{Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄})} Spec K, ℱ) = H^q(Spec K, ℱ)` does, each
equality read as bijectivity of the canonical restriction map.

The limit presentation of the two cohomology groups over `Spec(𝒪^{sh}_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` as
locally constant functions on a nonempty space is carried as the explicit datum
`Stacks.EtaleCohomology.SepClosedFiberLocallyConstantPresentation`; what is proved here is the
equivalence, which comes down to post-composition with a map being bijective on locally constant
functions on a nonempty space exactly when the map is. -/
@[stacks 0EZV "the equivalence of the tag's two conditions. What is carried as the explicit datum
`Stacks.EtaleCohomology.SepClosedFiberLocallyConstantPresentation`, rather than constructed, is
exactly the COHOMOLOGICAL identification of the source's proof: that the two cohomology groups
over `Spec(O^sh_{S,s̄}) ×_S Spec K` are locally constant functions on the limit index space with
values in the two groups over `Spec K`, compatibly with restriction. The geometric input it rests
on is proved here, not assumed -- the fibre product is affine
(`isAffine_strictHenselizationBaseFiber`), is `Spec` of a ring ind-étale over `K`
(`indEtale_strictHenselizationBaseFiberRing`, from `indEtale_etaleLocalRing` and Stacks 0BSH),
and each étale `K`-algebra of such a presentation has `Spec` a finite coproduct of copies of
`Spec K` (`specIsoSigmaOfIsSepClosed`). Three things block constructing the datum: Theorem 09YQ
is available only as the right-derived `sheafSections` of the small AFFINE étale site and its
transport to the `Sheaf.H` of the small étale site, which is what
`Stacks.EtaleCohomology.etaleCohomologyRestrictionMap` is stated for, needs a general-degree
comparison `Sheaf.H = rightDerived sheafSections` that exists nowhere at these universes; the
passage from `StacksDraft.IndEtale` to an explicit cofiltered limit of schemes is unavailable;
and the source's identification of the base change along the morphism of strict henselizations of
the different copies of `Spec K` in a stage -- distinct `K`-points of `Spec(O^sh_{S,s̄})`, Galois
twists of one another -- is suppressed in the source and not available either. The datum asserts
only the cohomological identification, not the equivalence, which is proved here"]
